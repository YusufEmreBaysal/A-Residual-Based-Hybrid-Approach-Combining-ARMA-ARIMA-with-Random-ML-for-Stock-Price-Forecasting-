A Residual-Based Hybrid Approach Combining ARMA/ARIMA with Random Forest and GBM for ASELSAN Stock Price Forecasting 

This study evaluates ARMA, ARIMA, Random Forest, and GBM models, along with their hybrid combinations using residuals, for forecasting ASELSAN stock prices especially focuses on hybrid models and its effects on forecasting future values. Study shows that differenced data significantly improved machine learning model accuracy. While ARMA-based hybrids reduced performance, ARIMA-based hybrids enhanced it. The best results were obtained from Random Forest and GBM models trained on differenced data. These findings highlight the potential of integrating statistical and machine learning methods to improve stock price prediction.
